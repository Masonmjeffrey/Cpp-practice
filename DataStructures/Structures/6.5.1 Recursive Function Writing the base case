Write code to complete DoublePennies()'s base case. Sample output for below program with inputs 1 and 10:
Number of pennies after 10 days: 1024
Note: If the submitted code has an infinite loop, the system will stop running the code after a few seconds, and report "Program end never reached." The system doesn't print the test case that caused the reported message.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Returns number of pennies if pennies are doubled numDays times
long long DoublePennies(long long numPennies, int numDays){
   long long totalPennies;

   /* Your solution goes here  */
   if (numDays == 0){
      return numPennies;
   }

   else {
      totalPennies = DoublePennies((numPennies * 2), numDays - 1);
   }

   return totalPennies;
}

// Program computes pennies if you have 1 penny today,
// 2 pennies after one day, 4 after two days, and so on
int main() {
   long long startingPennies;
   int userDays;

   cin >> startingPennies;
   cin >> userDays;
   cout << "Number of pennies after " << userDays << " days: "
        << DoublePennies(startingPennies, userDays) << endl;
   return 0;
}
