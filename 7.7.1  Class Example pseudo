Set the product result product = first position of vector productList

}


Iterations
currPrice = 9
currPrice has positive value so read currName = Berries
currentProduct productPrice = 9, productName = Berries
append currProduct to the vector productList
currPrice = 8
currPrice has positive value so read currName = Flowers
currProduct productPrice, productName = Flowers
append currProduct to the vector productList
currPrice = 13
currPrice has positive value so read currName = Shirt
currProduct productPrice = 13, ProductName = Shirt
append currProduct to the vector productList
currPrice = -1
currPrice does not have a positive value so end the while loop


Second Loop
Check each element of the vector productList if the price at position i is greater
than the price of resultProduct then set the result product = product.at(i);


productList[(9, Berries), (8, Flowers), (13, Shirt)]
